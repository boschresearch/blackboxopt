# Optimization Loops

We include a handful optimization loop implementations for different scenarios from a
simple [sequential](sequential.md) loop to one [distributed](dask-distributed.md)
potentially across nodes in a cluster setup.
Additionally, a set of [reference tests](testing.md) are included for
anyone extending the selection of optimization loops as part of a contribution to
`blackboxopt` or in a separate project.
