# BoTorch Base Optimizer

This optimizer is a basic Gaussian Process based Bayesian optimization implementation
leveraging BoTorch in a way that is compatible with the `blackboxopt` interface.
While this is a functional optimizer, it is more intended as a basis for other BoTorch
based optimizer implementations.
